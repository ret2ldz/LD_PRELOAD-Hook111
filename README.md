# LD_PRELOAD-Hook111
Develop a dynamic library that is injected into a target process via the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to intercept specific libc functions (such as malloc, free, strcpy, system, etc.). This can be used for:
'Behavior Monitoring: Logging function call arguments and return values to analyze program behavior.'
'Basic Security Auditing: Detecting the use of dangerous functions (e.g., strcpy) or performing preliminary input validation.'
'Simplified Memory Leak Detection: Tracking malloc/free pairing.'
